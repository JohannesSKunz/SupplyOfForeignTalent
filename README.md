## Overview 

This repository contains replication data for [Beerli, Indergand and Kunz (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3674880). 

First, we present the crosswalks. 

Second, the various source data sets we use. 

Finally, the estimation do-files generate our main results. 

For any questions on these please contact [Johannes Kunz](mailto:johannes.kunz@monash.edu)

## Source files  

We do not re-post the publicly available datasets from the various sources here since they belong to different entities, however, we present all sources and do-files extracting and preparing the data. If interested in the exact datasets (in case there are updates or they are not available anymore, please contact us directly).
